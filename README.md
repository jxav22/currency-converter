# React Chat Frontend with Material-UI

This project is a React-based chat interface styled using Material-UI components. It communicates with a backend server to process user inputs and provide responses in a conversation-style format. The application is designed for simplicity and modern UI design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Conversation**: Allows users to send messages and receive bot responses dynamically.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Material-UI for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when the backend is unavailable.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **npm** or **yarn**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
3. **Backend Server**: Ensure the backend server from the provided code is running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend API

The React frontend communicates with a backend server running at `http://localhost:3000`. The backend is responsible for processing user inputs and returning bot responses.

### Backend Endpoint
- **POST `/prompt`**
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "prompt": "<user-input>"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "<bot-response>"
    }
    ```

Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

## Customization

### 1. Styling
- Modify the Material-UI theme or add custom styles in `App.js` or `App.css`.

### 2. Components
- Refactor the code into reusable components by creating a `components` folder and breaking `App.js` into smaller components.

### 3. Backend URL
- If the backend server runs on a different URL or port, update the API URL in `App.js`:
  ```javascript
  const response = await axios.post('http://<your-backend-url>/prompt', { prompt: input });
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Not Found**:
   - Ensure the backend server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Check the network configuration.

2. **Dependency Errors**:
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

3. **Port Conflict**:
   - If `http://localhost:3000` is already in use, change the port in the backend or React app.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more advanced conversation flows.
- Implement user authentication for personalized chats.
- Enhance error handling and UI feedback.
